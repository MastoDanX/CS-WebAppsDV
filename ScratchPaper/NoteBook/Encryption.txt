get username
get password

store them in the database
user can be directly stored
password should be hashed then sent to the database

when username is given, get the hash of the password
went password entered is hashed compare to the stored hash to see if they are the same

issues arise during this comparison that makes a vulnerable point for hackers to get the information

to solve this a session token can be used
    these tokens have a short expiration time
